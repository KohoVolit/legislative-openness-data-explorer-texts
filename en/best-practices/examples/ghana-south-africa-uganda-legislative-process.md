# Citizens are invited to have their say in the legislative process in Ghana, South Africa and Uganda

In Ghana, memoranda are welcomed from the public on any bill before committee.  The South African Parliament allows for “submissions” to committees as well, and provides a simple description for how citizens may use this tool in its website. While in Uganda, members of the public may appear before parliament to give evidence on an item in the budget.
