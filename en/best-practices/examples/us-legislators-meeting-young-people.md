# In the U.D. the ‘America’s Legislators Back to School’ programme enables legislators to meet with young people

In the United States, the National Conference of State Legislatures operates a programme taking America’s Legislators Back to School. The programme gives elected parliamentarians in all 50 states the opportunity to meet personally with their young constituents and to answer questions, share ideas, and listen to concerns. The programme is designed to teach young people what it is like to be a state legislator: the processes, the pressures, and the debate, negotiation and compromise. The programme is emphasised as a bipartisan event.
