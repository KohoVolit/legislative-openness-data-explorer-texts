# The Scottish parliament has developed a series of key principles that guide the practices of parliament and the work of MSPs

After a wide public consultation process, the Scottish Parliament published a set of Key Principles in 1999, ‘Shaping Scotland’s Parliament’ which set out how the Parliament should work. The Principles are:

Accountable: the Scottish Parliament is answerable to the people of Scotland. The Scottish Parliament should hold the Scottish Government to account; Open and Encourage participation: the Scottish Parliament should be accessible and involve the people of Scotland in its decisions as much as possible; Power Sharing: power should be shared among the Scottish Government, the Scottish Parliament and the people of Scotland, and Equal Opportunities: the Scottish Parliament should treat all people fairly.
