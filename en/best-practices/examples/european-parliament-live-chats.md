# The European Parliament runs live chats on Facebook with MEPs

The European Parliament has undertaken a strategy to engage the public in the places where they are and to use social media tools to promote public understanding and interest in the parliament. It has developed custom applications inside Facebook to run live chats with members, to ﬁnd their local MEP and connect to his/her Facebook page. It has also run a competition to select a citizen to be a Facebook “editor” for a day.
