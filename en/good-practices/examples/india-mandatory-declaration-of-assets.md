# In India, a declaration of assets is mandatory within 90 days of taking office as a member of parliament

In India, voters have the fundamental right to know the financial background of any person contesting elections to Parliament. Since 2003, it has become common practice for candidates contesting elections to Parliament to submit an official declaration disclosing details of assets and liabilities for self, spouse and three dependents.  The Election Commission of India is required to make these affidavits public so that voters may get to know the background of electoral candidates.

After a candidate wins elections to either House of Parliament it becomes mandatory for them to declare their assets (movable and immovable property for self, spouse and dependent children) within 90 days of taking oath of office as an MP. Liabilities to public financial institutions and the central and any state government must also be disclosed.
