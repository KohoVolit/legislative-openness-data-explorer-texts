# In the US, the "America’s Legislators Back to School" program enables legislators to meet with young people

In the United States, the National Conference of State Legislatures operates a program called "America’s Legislators Back to School". The program gives elected parliamentarians in all 50 states the opportunity to meet personally with their young constituents and to answer questions, share ideas, and listen to concerns. The program is designed to teach young people what it is like to be a state legislator: the processes, the pressures, and the debate, negotiation and compromise. The program is emphasised as a bipartisan event.
