# The Finnish parliament works with external groups to engage citizens

The Finnish Eduskuntaâ€™s Committee for the Future is partnering with domestic and international research organisations, universities and institutions to address challenges of citizen engagement in the legislative process. It is also integrating new technologies into its methods of work, including exploring the use of social media during hearings and exploiting crowdsourcing techniques to boost citizen feedback.
