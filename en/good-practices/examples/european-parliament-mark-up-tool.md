# The European Parliament has provided open source access to its legislative mark-up tool

The European Parliament is since 2010 using an open source release of AT4AM. This is a web-based amendment authoring tool used to create and table amendments on the proposals of the European Commission and the Council of the European Union, and the reports of the parliamentary committees. Until February 2013, 250.000 amendments had been created with AT4AM.
