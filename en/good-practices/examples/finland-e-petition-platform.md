# Finland setup an e-petition platform that enables citizens to propose legislation

Open Ministry is a civil society e-petition platform that enables citizens to propose legislation to Finlandâ€™s Parliament. Any proposal that receives over 50,000 signatures is automatically considered by the Parliament. Issues that have thus far received more than 50,000 signatures and have come up for parliamentary consideration include banning farming of animals for their furs, copyright regulation, allowing same-sex marriages, and making Swedish language non-mandatory for Finnish students.
