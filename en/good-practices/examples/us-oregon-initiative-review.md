# The U.S. state of Oregon aims to improve political participation through its citizens’ initiative review

In Oregon, the Citizens’ Initiative Review was established in 2009 to improve the quality of public participation and political deliberation. It brings together 24 randomly selected, demographically diverse voters for 5 days to review evidence, talk to experts, hear from campaigns, and discuss a ballot measure that citizens will vote on when they go to the polls. They ultimately produce a citizen statement reviewing the facts and arguments. Each citizen statement is published as a prominent page in the voters’ pamphlet as a new and easily accessible resource for voters to use at election time.

A 2012 evaluation found the citizen statements to be “highly deliberative”, “high level of factual accuracy”, and insightful from the perspective of two-thirds of citizens who read them.
