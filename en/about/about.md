# About the Legislative Openness Data Explorer

<br>
### Background and General
<br>
##### Why global, comparative data on parliamentary openness? 

Around the world, an increasing number of parliaments are embracing the principles of parliamentary openness: ensuring public access to legislative information, providing opportunities for meaningful citizen participation, and embracing the possibilities presented by new technologies. The [Open Government Partnership](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/) (OGP) has provided an international platform for these parliaments to exchange experience, share good practice, and, in some cases, advance reform. OGP’s [Legislative Openness Working Group](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/groups/legislative) compiled the data featured on this site.

Despite growing interest in the topic of legislative openness around the world, relatively few global studies have been conducted. The Global Centre for ICT in Parliament’s [World e-Parliament Report 2012](http://www.ictparliament.org/WePReport2012.html) collected some of this information, though that report does not focus exclusively on openness and covers a broader range of issues related to parliament and technology. Civil society groups have also conducted strong regional studies, such as the work of [KohoVolit](http://kohovolit.eu/) and the [Latin American Legislative Transparency Network](http://www.transparencialegislativa.org/). Regional studies are important, but it can also be valuable for civil society groups and parliaments to compare performance with countries around the world. 

It is important to capture comparative information on legislative openness at a global scale because innovation and good practice can originate anywhere. This site is an effort to ensure that global good practice is being effectively captured and shared.

##### Can I reuse the data on this site?

Yes! Reuse is strongly encouraged, and all the data is freely available for download. The site and all data is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).  
<br>
##### How can this data can be used? 

All the data is freely available for [download](http://beta.openparldata.org/download/) and basic analyses and comparisons can be conducted on the [Explore](http://beta.openparldata.org/explore/) page. Reuse is encouraged to enable users to find creative ways to use this data to advance legislative openness. 

For those working in [OGP member countries](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/countries), the site can support the development of legislative openness commitments. If a parliament is interested in a commitment to publish more information on committee proceedings, for example, this data can both provide a snapshot of global practice and highlight good practice examples. Those who are not in an OGP member country will also find the data to be helpful, as the scope is not limited to OGP participants. 

Civil society organizations may find this site to be a valuable advocacy tool. By comparing the performance of legislatures around the world, the site can incentivize reform and support calls for greater openness. The data and good practices can also help shape openness reform agendas.

##### How reliable is the Legislative Openness Data Explorer? 

As this information was crowdsourced, no assurance of accuracy can be given and data may contain errors or be incomplete. By using this data in any way, the user must acknowledge this limitation. Users are encouraged to contribute to the data to ensure the site reflects the most up to date information on parliamentary openness practices.  
<br>
##### Will translation be available? 

The site administrators would welcome volunteer support to develop translated versions of the site. If interested, please contact the site administrators at admin@openparldata.org. 

It is also important to note that the survey was circulated in English only, due in part to the Working Group’s limited capacity. Given the highly technical nature of the survey, it is possible that circulating in English created limited data quality issues. To help address any such issues, see the [Contribute](http://beta.openparldata.org/contribute/) page.

### Methodology
<br>
##### How was this data collected? 

All the of the collected data displayed on the website was gathered through survey based research. The information currently on the site was compiled by circulating a survey on the transparency and accessibility of parliamentary information. Additional surveys will be circulated throughout 2016, likely covering legislative ethics regimes and mechanisms citizen participation in the legislative process. The first survey can be seen [here](http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/1766975/Global-Legislative-Openness-Survey-Part-1).   

The initial survey was based in part on the [Declaration on Parliamentary Openness](http://www.openingparliament.org/declaration), a series of principles on parliamentary transparency and citizen participation in the legislative process. In particular, the first survey considers the Declaration’s principles on public access to legislative information. Based on these principles, the first survey considers what information is published in addition to when, how, and in what formats that information is published.

All the data displayed on this site was collected through an open survey research process. The site administrators are relying on the expertise of external experts to complete the survey and provide the necessary information. As such, it is expected that not all of the information on this site is accurate. Users are encouraged to either complete the survey themselves or suggest changes to the information as it is displayed. Both civil society groups and parliaments completed the survey and provided data for the site. 

In instances when multiple actors completed the survey for the same chamber of parliament, the site administrators have worked to resolve inconsistencies or disagreements in as fair a manner as possible. That being said, community involvement is essential to ensure the most accurate information. For more information on how you can get involved, see the CONTRIBUTE page.  
<br>
##### What do the green, yellow, and red icon represent? 

At the [Explore](http://beta.openparldata.org/explore/) page of this site, users can generate unique data tables and maps to easily analyze the information. In both instances, you will see that chambers of parliament are given either a red, green, or yellow icon for each question. Typically, green indicates that the data is available in open formats, yellow that the data is available but not in open formats, and red that the data is not available. These colored icons are intended to provide a general overview of data availability, and should not be considered to be a score or indication of performance. 

To learn more about each data point, users may click on the green, yellow, or red icon. Doing so will produce a dialogue box with detailed information, including: the survey questions and answer, contextual information about that specific data point, and other helpful information to help understand parliamentary performance on this specific issue.

### Site Administration
<br>
##### Who manages this site? 

The site is managed by the [Open Government Partnership’s Legislative Openness Working Group](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/groups/legislative), which is co-chaired by the [Congress of Chile](http://www.congreso.cl/) and the [National Democratic Institute](https://www.ndi.org/). [KohoVolit](http://kohovolit.eu/), a Czech and Slovak parliamentary monitoring organization, provided technical support in the design and construction of the site. In addition to these groups, numerous civil society organizations and parliaments contributed data.  
<br>
##### How can I contribute? 

As a community project, the Legislative Openness Data Explorer relies on contributions from civil society organizations, researchers, parliamentary representatives, and others. Anyone with relevant expertise can contribute by adding data for a chamber of parliament, suggesting edits to existing data, or contributing good practice examples. See the [Contribute](http://beta.openparldata.org/contribute/) page for more information.
