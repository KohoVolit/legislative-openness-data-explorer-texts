# In Croatia there is widespread collaboration between parliamentarians and civil society representatives

In Croatia, requests to hold a roundtable at Parliament are frequently approved by the Secretary of the Parliament, while many civil society organisations cooperate directly with parliamentary committees on round tables or thematic open sessions. Committee chairs have the right to invite NGO representatives to committee sessions to obtain additional information on reviewed bills.

Each committee has 3-7 external permanent committee members from think tanks, interest groups or NGOs. The external permanent committee members are elected through a public announcement and have the right to participate in committee discussions, but cannot vote. They receive monthly remuneration (approximately €260) and are entitled to reimbursement of travel expenses.
