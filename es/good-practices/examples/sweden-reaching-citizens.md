# The Swedish parliament reaches out to citizens in a variety of ways

In Sweden, parliament reaches out to citizens through regional surveys or by holding panels of MPs in local districts. Parliament has also opened regional ‘branches’ throughout the country, where citizens can access educational and informational material on parliament and follow live broadcasts of parliamentary proceedings. These branches serve as meeting places for MPs and voters.
